# We took a little look on os module. Write a small script which will print a string using all the types 
# of string formatting which were considered during the lecture with the following context:
# This script has the following PID: <ACTUAL_PID_HERE>. It was ran by <ACTUAL_USERNAME_HERE> 
# to work happily on <ACTUAL_OS_NAME>-<ACTUAL_OS_RELEASE>.
