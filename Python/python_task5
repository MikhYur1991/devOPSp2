# Develop a function that takes a list of integers (by idea not in fact) as an argument and returns 
# list of top-three max integers. If passed list contains not just integers collect them and print 
# the following error message: You've passed some extra elements that I can't parse: [<"elem1", "elem2" .... >]. 
# If return value will have less than 3 elements for some reason it's ok and shouldn't cause any problem,
# but some list should be returned in any case.
