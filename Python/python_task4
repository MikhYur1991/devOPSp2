# We took a little look on os module. Write a small script which will print a string using all the types 
# of string formatting which were considered during the lecture with the following context:
# This script has the following PID: <ACTUAL_PID_HERE>. It was ran by <ACTUAL_USERNAME_HERE> 
# to work happily on <ACTUAL_OS_NAME>-<ACTUAL_OS_RELEASE>.

import os

print("This script has the following PID:",os.getpid(),". It was run by ",os.getlogin()," to work happily on ",os.uname().sysname,"-",os.uname().version)

print("This script has the following PID:{0}. It was run by {1} to work happily on {2}-{3}".\
format(os.getpid(),os.getlogin(),os.uname().sysname,os.uname().version))

pid = os.getpid()
username = os.getlogin()
osver = os.uname().sysname + "-" + os.uname().version
